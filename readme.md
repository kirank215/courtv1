## Context
Look at [Version 0](https://github.com/kirank215/courtv0) for context.

## Improvements
We could make use of the filter option provided by the website.\
This option generates a new dynamic url for every search (which can be dissected with a bit of reverse engineering)

## How does the application work?
 This application directly opens the url for a specific name and date in a browser.
 
## Why not use the filter directly on their website?
You can add this executable to your list of apps on 'right click' which makes it much faster to open.\
It takes lot of time to reach the filter page and choose the appropriate filters

## Drawbacks
The date and name cannot be changed. (Date is always set to today)\
No notifications

## Can we do better?
